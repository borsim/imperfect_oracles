This repo contains all the code responsible for generating the experiment data and all the code responsible for evaluating it.
The project extends Dave Cliff's BSE code - https://github.com/davecliff/BristolStockExchange 
Not all generated data files are uploaded to this repo, only the ones used in the final, written evaluation. Smaller-scale experiments, data that was corrupted one way or another (e.g. a bug in the code or issues with buffering during .csv writing) or was not fully used is not included.

All code is provided under the MIT License. In short: free use, no warranties.
If this code is used or helps in a scientific project, I would highly appreciate being cited.
